      <h1>Thurgood Marshall, the one lawyer and judge that strived to protect the rights of all citizens.</h1>
      <h1> Marshall’s amazing legacy earned him the name “Mr. Civil Rights.” </h1>
      <h1>He was rejected from the University of Maryland Law School due to his race.</h1>
      <h1>His physical courage, his intellectual brilliance and professional expertise, his moral strength, and his utter disregard for fame and wealth made Marshall who he was. </h1>
      <h1>Since young age, Marshall did not struggle with money, but his family was not awfully rich. </h1>
